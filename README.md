# TravelJet
The TravelJet is a web based application. The main purpose of this platform is to provide a convenient way for a customer to plan and schedule their tours. The objective of this project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of a travel agency. In this project, We will make an easier task of searching places and for booking train, flight or bus. In the present system a customer has to approach various agencies to find details of places and to book tickets. This often requires a lot of time and effort. We provide approach skills to critically examine how a tourist visits and its ability to operate in an appropriate way when dealing with the consequences of tourism, locally, regionally, and nationally including visitor security and ecological influences. It is tedious for a customer to plan a particular journey and have it executed properly. The project ‘TravelJet’ is developed to replace the currently existing system, which helps in keeping records of the customer details of destination as well as payment received.

# Objective

We have developed tours and travel management system to provide a search platform where a tourist can find their tour places according to their choices. This system also helps to promote responsible and interesting tourism so that people can enjoy their holidays at their favorable places. This system also helps to develop tourism with different cultures so that they enrich the tourism experience and build pride. We develop this system to create and promote forms of tourism that provide healthy interaction opportunities for tourists and locals and increase better understanding of different cultures, customs, lifestyles, traditional knowledge and believes. This system also provide a better way to connect with various events.
